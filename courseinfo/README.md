# Exercise 2.1/2.3: Course information step6-8

Cleaned the code. Now, the total exercises sums the number of exercises of each part with a `reduce` method of the `map` containing all the exercises numbers.

# Exercise 2.4: Course information step9

`course` variable is now an array of objets which are the courses.
Created a `courses` array which is a mapped version of `course`containing Course Components which is then rendered in the App Component.

Did the same to Parts(stored in a variable with map and rendered as a list)
